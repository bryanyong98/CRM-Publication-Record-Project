# CRM-Publication-Record-Project

This project was worked on during the one-month break from university studies. The software is mainly used to minimise redundancies and manual effort that are required when sorting publication records. 


The developed software allows the upload of CSV files of affiliations and returns an updated CSV with all necessary information as required by the Campus Research Management staff members.
